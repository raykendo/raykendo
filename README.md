### :wave: Hello 

I'm Ken Doman (he, him), developer with a geospatial twist. I've forgotten more tricks to make websites work in IE6 than you will ever know. By day, I'm a software developer who adapts geospatial data into formats people can consume (websites, web maps, pdf reports, spreadsheets, etc). I typically work with Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Python, C#, Powershell, and Node.js, but I'm happy to learn anything.
